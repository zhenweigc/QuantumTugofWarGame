    "There are two teams in this game, Team $\\ket{0}$ and Team $\\ket{1}$. They take turns getting control of a rotating qubit $\\ket{\\psi}$. In between the teams' turns, the qubit rotates by either $\\theta$ or $-\\theta$ depending on the current **direction of rotation**. At the beginning, the qubit starts rotating in the direction of $\\theta$.\n",

    "During their turn, each team can choose to perform an **action** from their **hand** (think of an action as a \"card\"). Here are possible actions that a team can have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Measure_: this measures $\\ket{\\psi}$ in the standard basis. \n",
    "2. _X_: apply Pauli $X$ gate to $\\ket{\\psi}$.\n",
    "3. _Z_: apply Pauli $Z$ gate to $\\ket{\\psi}$.\n",
    "4. _H_: apply the Hadamard $H$ gate to $\\ket{\\psi}$.\n",
    "5. _R_: reverse the direction of the qubit rotation (i.e. qubit gets rotated by $-\\theta$ instead of $\\theta$ and vice versa).\n",

    "2. `round_number`: this indicates which round (between $0$ and $T = 200$) the bot is currently playing\n",
    "3. `hand`: this is a list of `GameAction`s that is available for the bot to play. There are several GameActions that can be played:\n",

The `team0/1_action` entries store the `GameAction` that was performed by the team, or `None` if they didn't perform an action. If a team performed a measurement action, then the `team0/1_measurement` entries indicate the result of a measurement(either `[1,0]` or `[0,1]` to indicate collapsing to $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$). If the team didn't perform a measurement action, then this entry will be set to `None`.\n",
